# CGE | Canvas Game Engine - Simplified Interaction with Canvas

CGE is a simpler way to interface with the regular HTML5 Canvas, with easy access to changing game loops, best practicies for modern browsers, and features that apply to any game.

CGE is not really an engine, just a boilerplate reducer for writing browser games. Features currently are really limited to just increasing readability in the actual game logic file, but I am planning to add features most games will use. Below are the current features completed and planned to add.

- [x] Game loop controls, Canvas cleaning, General Canvas boilerplate.
- [ ] Origin controls, Screen offset, Scaling
- [ ] Input manager

# Installation

``` 
git clone https://github.com/brandonwbenbow/cge.git
```

# Usage

Currently, Node is being used in the included starting content, but PHP could be used in its place. Node packages will not be included in the engine itself, but may show up in the starting content. If that is the case, installation will be changed to reflect that.

``` 
node index.js 
```

or

``` 
npm start
```
